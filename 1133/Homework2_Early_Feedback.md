### Early Feedback for Homework 2 (THIS IS NOT YOUR GRADE, the assignment isn't due yet)

These tests are run on Monday and Tuesday nights some time after 10:00 PM, so if you didn't submit before then you can ignore this document

Passing these tests is not a guarantee of a perfect homework score: the tests do not check everything that the TAs will.  In particular for this assignment, the tests can't test whether star8() draws the correct shape, only that it doesn't error.  They also don't check the intermediate values that are printed in trajectory, only the final return value.

Any questions/errors with the Automated Feedback should be reported to Nathan Taylor: taylo740@umn.edu
