### Early Feedback for Homework 3 (THIS IS NOT YOUR GRADE, the assignment isn't due yet)

These tests are run on Monday and Tuesday nights some time after 10:00 PM, so if you didn't submit before then you can ignore this document

Passing these tests is not a guarantee of a perfect homework score: the tests do not check everything that the TAs will.

Any questions/errors with the Automated Feedback should be reported to Nathan Taylor: taylo740@umn.edu

Disclaimer on this week's test in particular: the testing script is not particularly good at handling user input problems.

You might get some very strange feedback on parts B or C if you call input the wrong number of total times or cause errors.

Run on February 11, 23:14:12 PM.
